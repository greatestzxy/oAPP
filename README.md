The code includes twp parts, number/letter recognition and face recognition.

if you want to test the face reognition part, try cd Source -> python part1_face_recognition.py --test_data_path= path_to_video  --expected= expect_input --name=expecte_patient name

if you want to test the number reognition part, try cd Source -> python part2_number_recognition.py --test_data_path= path_to_video  --expected= expect_input --name=expecte_patient name

for example:python part1_face_recognition.py - -test_data_path=test.mp4 - -expected="E4" - -name="xiyuan"

Please contact me(zhaoxiyuan2019@163.com) to get the database and testing video.

If you already have the database of face recognition and want to add new persons to it, please put the pictures under the folder ../Images/database/group3 and rename it as "name.jpg"(i.e.,xiyuan.jpg).
